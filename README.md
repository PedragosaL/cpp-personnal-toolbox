# C++ Toolbox

This repository is a personal collection of C++ utilities, helpers, and code snippets that I have written. The purpose of this repo is to store reusable pieces of C++ code that might be helpful to me in future projects.

Feel free to use any part of this repository in your own work â€” no credit or attribution is required.
